# Udacity-Deep-Learning

These are work and projects I developed as a part of [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101).

## Installation

The `requirements.txt` file describes the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Software Requirements

To run the notebook yourself, you'll need Python 3 or above, and iPython Jupyter Notebook.

If you don't want to run the notebook, you can simply open the 'html' files included, and follow the notebook as a website.
